# NLP Project
## The Task
Project two in our course Artificial Intelligence is to create a model NLP on the IMDB dataset.

Train a neural network that is at least better than random guessing on your dataset. The template contains the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis, however, you can choose any other language related data set with the appropriate NLP task.

The data contains 25000 training samples and 25000 test samples.
